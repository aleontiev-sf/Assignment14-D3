            <h4>Health and Poverty</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>
				This chart depicts the relationship between excellent health and poverty
				level for various states. There is a significat negative correlation 
				between these two factors: As the percentage of people in poverty increases,
                the percentage of people who report to be in excellent health decreases--Washington
                DC is an exception.
            </p>
            <p>	Note that this is not necessarily a causal relationship; i.e., poverty 
				does not cause poor health. Most likely this negative relationship is the
				result of other health factors and habbits in poorer populations that lead 
                to lower levels of health.
